# Nutrition Targets Reference

## Calorie Methodology

### Basal Metabolic Rate (Mifflin-St Jeor)
- Male: BMR = (10 x weight_kg) + (6.25 x height_cm) - (5 x age) + 5
- Female: BMR = (10 x weight_kg) + (6.25 x height_cm) - (5 x age) - 161

### Activity Multipliers (TDEE = BMR x factor)
- Sedentary (desk job, no exercise): 1.2
- Lightly active (1-3 days/week): 1.375
- Moderately active (3-5 days/week): 1.55
- Very active (6-7 days/week): 1.725
- Extremely active (athlete / physical job + training): 1.9

### Goal-Specific Calorie Adjustments
- **Weight loss**: TDEE minus 500 kcal/day (targets ~0.45 kg/week loss). Never go below BMR. Aggressive cut: minus 750 kcal max, only short-term (4-8 weeks).
- **Muscle gain (lean bulk)**: TDEE plus 250-350 kcal/day. Beginners can use up to +500 due to newbie gains.
- **Maintenance**: TDEE +/- 100 kcal. Use for diet breaks and recomposition phases.
- **Recomposition**: Eat at maintenance with high protein. Works best for beginners, overweight individuals, or detrained lifters.

## Protein

### Targets by Goal
- Sedentary maintenance: 0.8 g/kg body weight (RDA minimum)
- Recreationally active: 1.2-1.6 g/kg
- Muscle gain / hypertrophy: 1.6-2.2 g/kg
- Fat loss while preserving muscle: 2.0-2.4 g/kg (higher end during deficit)
- Endurance athletes: 1.2-1.6 g/kg

### Protein Distribution
- Spread across 3-5 meals for optimal muscle protein synthesis (MPS)
- Each meal: minimum 0.3-0.5 g/kg (roughly 20-40g per meal for most people)
- MPS refractory period: ~3-5 hours between protein feedings for re-stimulation
- Pre-sleep casein or mixed protein (30-40g) supports overnight MPS

### Quality Considerations
- Leucine threshold for MPS: ~2.5-3g per meal
- Complete protein sources (all essential amino acids): meat, fish, eggs, dairy, soy
- Plant proteins: combine sources (legumes + grains) or use higher total intake (+10-20%)

## Carbohydrates

### Baseline Targets
- General health: 3-5 g/kg/day
- Moderate training (1 hr/day): 5-7 g/kg/day
- High volume training (1-3 hr/day): 6-10 g/kg/day
- Ultra endurance (4+ hr/day): 8-12 g/kg/day

### Carb Periodization
- **Rest days**: Lower end of range; prioritize complex/slow-digesting carbs
- **Training days**: Higher end of range; include fast-digesting carbs around workout
- **Pre-workout (1-2 hrs before)**: 1-2 g/kg from low-fiber, moderate-GI sources
- **Intra-workout (sessions >90 min)**: 30-60g/hr from simple sugars
- **Post-workout (within 2 hrs)**: 1-1.5 g/kg to replenish glycogen; pair with protein

### Fiber
- Men: 30-38 g/day
- Women: 21-25 g/day
- Sources: vegetables, legumes, whole grains, fruits
- Keep fiber low in the immediate pre/post workout window to avoid GI distress

## Fats

### Minimum Requirements
- Absolute minimum: 0.5 g/kg/day (hormonal floor -- do not go below)
- Recommended minimum: 0.8-1.0 g/kg/day
- General target: 25-35% of total calories
- Very low fat diets (<15% calories) risk hormonal disruption (testosterone, estrogen)

### Fat Sources and Types
- **Saturated**: limit to <10% of total calories (meat, dairy, coconut oil)
- **Monounsaturated**: olive oil, avocado, nuts -- prioritize these
- **Polyunsaturated**: fish, flaxseed, walnuts
- **Trans fats**: avoid entirely (partially hydrogenated oils)

### Omega-3 Fatty Acids
- EPA + DHA combined target: 1.5-3g/day for active individuals
- Anti-inflammatory, supports recovery, cardiovascular health, brain function
- Fatty fish 2-3x/week or supplement with fish oil
- Plant-based alternative: algae-derived DHA/EPA (ALA conversion is inefficient, ~5-10%)

## Micronutrients

### Sodium
- General limit: 2300 mg/day (about 1 tsp salt)
- Active individuals losing significant sweat: may need 3000-5000 mg on heavy training days
- Hyponatremia risk during prolonged exercise with only water intake
- Signs of excess: bloating, elevated blood pressure, water retention

### Potassium
- Target: 2600-3400 mg/day (most people are deficient)
- Sodium-potassium balance matters more than absolute sodium intake
- Sources: potatoes, bananas, spinach, avocado, beans

### Magnesium
- Target: 310-420 mg/day (sex-dependent; higher for males)
- Involved in 300+ enzymatic processes; critical for sleep, muscle function, recovery
- Common deficiency in athletes due to sweat losses
- Forms: magnesium glycinate (sleep), citrate (general), avoid oxide (poor absorption)

### Other Key Micronutrients for Active Individuals
- **Vitamin D**: 1000-2000 IU/day; test levels annually; target 40-60 ng/mL
- **Iron**: critical for oxygen transport; menstruating women and endurance athletes at higher risk of deficiency
- **Zinc**: 8-11 mg/day; supports immune function and testosterone
- **Calcium**: 1000-1300 mg/day; prioritize dietary sources

## Hydration

### Baseline Protocol
- Minimum: 8 x 250 mL glasses/day (2 liters)
- Better baseline: 35 mL per kg body weight
- Add 500 mL per hour of exercise
- Add 250-500 mL in hot/humid conditions

### Monitoring Hydration
- Urine color: pale yellow = adequate; dark yellow = dehydrated; clear = overhydrated
- Weigh before and after exercise: drink 1.5x the weight lost in fluid

### Electrolyte Needs During Exercise
- Sessions >60 minutes or heavy sweaters: add electrolytes
- Sodium: 300-600 mg per hour of exercise
- Potassium: 150-300 mg per hour
- Magnesium: 50-100 mg per hour
- Commercial electrolyte mixes or DIY: 1/4 tsp salt + squeeze of citrus per 500 mL

## Meal Timing

### General Principles
- Total daily intake matters most; timing is secondary but meaningful for performance
- Eat within 1-2 hours of waking to break overnight fast (unless following a deliberate fasting protocol)
- Pre-workout meal: 1-3 hours before; balanced protein + carbs, moderate fat
- Post-workout meal: within 2 hours; prioritize protein (30-50g) + fast carbs
- The "anabolic window" is wider than once believed (~4-6 hours around training) but still relevant for optimization
- Avoid large meals within 1 hour of training (GI discomfort, blood flow competition)

### Protein Timing Distribution
- 4 meals at ~equal protein is superior to 1-2 large protein meals
- Example for 160g target: 40g breakfast, 40g lunch, 40g dinner, 40g snack/shake
- Pre-sleep protein (casein or cottage cheese) supports overnight recovery
