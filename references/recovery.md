# Recovery Reference

## Sleep

### Targets
- General population: 7-9 hours per night
- Athletes and heavy trainees: 8-10 hours (sleep is the single most powerful recovery tool)
- Consistent sleep/wake times matter as much as total duration (circadian rhythm)
- Sleep debt is cumulative and cannot be fully repaid with a single long night

### Sleep Quality Markers
- Sleep latency (time to fall asleep): ideal <15 minutes; >30 min suggests issue
- Wake-after-sleep-onset (WASO): ideally <30 min total
- Sleep efficiency: time asleep / time in bed; target >85%
- REM and deep sleep proportions: most wearables track these; deep sleep is critical for physical recovery, REM for cognitive

### Sleep Hygiene Practices
- Room temperature: 65-68F (18-20C)
- Complete darkness; blackout curtains or sleep mask
- No screens 30-60 min before bed (blue light suppresses melatonin)
- Caffeine cutoff: 8-10 hours before bed (half-life is ~5-6 hours)
- Alcohol: even moderate amounts fragment sleep architecture; avoid within 3 hours of bed
- Consistent wake time is more important than consistent bedtime
- Morning sunlight exposure (10-20 min) within 1 hour of waking anchors circadian rhythm

### HRV and Sleep Correlation
- Heart Rate Variability (HRV) reflects autonomic nervous system balance
- Higher HRV generally indicates better recovery status
- Track HRV trends over weeks, not day-to-day (individual readings are noisy)
- Consistently low HRV + poor sleep = reduce training load
- Measure HRV at the same time daily (ideally upon waking) for reliable trends

## Rest Days

### Active Recovery
- Low-intensity movement: walking, light cycling, swimming, yoga
- Heart rate stays below 60% of max (zone 1)
- Duration: 20-40 minutes
- Purpose: increases blood flow to muscles, reduces DOMS perception, maintains movement habit
- Appropriate when: moderately sore, accumulated fatigue is manageable, no acute pain

### Complete Rest
- No structured exercise; daily living activities only
- Appropriate when: acutely sore or injured, highly elevated fatigue markers, illness, after competition/testing, mental burnout
- Minimum 1 complete rest day per week for most people
- Do not feel guilty about complete rest; adaptation happens during recovery, not during training

### Weekly Rest Structure
- Beginner (3 training days): 4 rest days (2 active, 2 complete)
- Intermediate (4-5 training days): 2-3 rest days (1-2 active, 1 complete)
- Advanced (5-6 training days): 1-2 rest days (1 active, 0-1 complete)
- Listen to biofeedback over rigid schedules

## Overtraining and Overreaching

### Functional Overreaching (short-term, intentional)
- Performance dip lasting days to ~2 weeks
- Followed by supercompensation if recovery is adequate
- Used strategically before deload phases

### Non-Functional Overreaching (problematic)
- Performance decline lasting weeks to months
- Accumulated fatigue without adequate recovery
- Recovery requires significant training reduction

### Overtraining Syndrome (clinical)
- Rare in recreational lifters but real in competitive athletes
- Requires medical evaluation and potentially months of recovery

### Warning Signs (monitor weekly)
- **Resting heart rate**: elevated 5-10+ bpm above personal baseline
- **HRV**: consistently below personal baseline for 5+ days
- **Sleep**: difficulty falling/staying asleep despite fatigue
- **Performance**: strength plateau or decline for 2+ consecutive sessions
- **Mood**: irritability, apathy, loss of motivation, anxiety, depression
- **Appetite**: significant decrease or increase outside normal patterns
- **Immune function**: frequent colds, slow wound healing
- **Joints/connective tissue**: persistent aches beyond normal DOMS (>72 hrs)
- **Libido**: noticeable decrease (hormonal disruption signal)

### Response Protocol
If 3+ warning signs present for 1+ weeks:
1. Immediately reduce training volume by 50%
2. Prioritize sleep (add 1 hour if possible)
3. Increase calorie intake to maintenance or slight surplus
4. Reassess after 1 week
5. If no improvement, take a full week off and consult a professional

## Nutrition for Recovery

### Post-Workout Nutrition
- Protein: 30-50g within 2 hours of training (leucine-rich sources preferred)
- Carbohydrates: 1-1.5 g/kg to replenish glycogen
- The urgency of post-workout nutrition increases with training frequency (if training same muscle again within 24 hrs, prioritize speed)

### Anti-Inflammatory Foods
- Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel): omega-3 EPA/DHA
- Berries (blueberries, tart cherry): anthocyanins
- Turmeric/curcumin: pair with black pepper (piperine) for absorption
- Ginger: 1-2g/day shows anti-inflammatory effects
- Dark leafy greens: magnesium, antioxidants
- Note: acute inflammation post-training is necessary for adaptation; do not aggressively suppress with NSAIDs after every session

### Hydration for Recovery
- Rehydrate fully before next training session
- Post-exercise: 1.5x fluid lost (weigh before/after to estimate)
- Include sodium (500-700mg per liter of fluid) for retention
- Chronic mild dehydration impairs recovery, sleep, and cognitive function

### Supplements with Recovery Evidence
- **Creatine monohydrate**: 3-5g/day; supports ATP regeneration, cell hydration, well-studied
- **Vitamin D**: 1000-2000 IU/day if levels are suboptimal (test annually)
- **Magnesium glycinate**: 200-400mg before bed; supports sleep and muscle relaxation
- **Tart cherry juice**: 240ml 2x/day around hard training; reduces DOMS markers
- **Collagen peptides**: 10-15g with vitamin C 30-60 min before training; tendon/ligament support

## Stress Management

### Cortisol and Body Composition
- Chronic elevated cortisol promotes visceral fat storage, muscle catabolism, water retention
- Cortisol is not inherently bad; acute spikes during training are normal and beneficial
- The problem is chronically elevated baseline cortisol from lifestyle stress
- High stress + caloric deficit = compounded negative effects (poor adherence, muscle loss, stalled fat loss)

### Stress Signals Relevant to Training
- If life stress is abnormally high (work, relationships, finances), treat it as additional training load
- Reduce training volume/intensity during high-stress periods rather than pushing through
- A stressful week is not the time to attempt PRs or add volume

### Evidence-Based Stress Reduction
- **Breathing exercises**: 5-min box breathing (4 sec inhale, 4 hold, 4 exhale, 4 hold) or physiological sigh (double inhale + long exhale) acutely lowers sympathetic tone
- **Meditation**: 10-20 min/day; reduces baseline cortisol over weeks
- **Nature exposure**: 20+ min outdoors reduces cortisol measurably
- **Social connection**: isolation increases stress hormones; maintain relationships
- **Training itself**: moderate exercise is a stress buffer, but excessive training becomes a stressor
- **Journaling/cognitive strategies**: externalizing worries reduces rumination

## Mobility and Soft Tissue Work

### Stretching
- **Static stretching**: hold 30-60 seconds per stretch, 2-3 sets; best done post-workout or on rest days
- **Dynamic stretching**: controlled movement through range of motion; ideal as part of warm-up
- Pre-workout static stretching may transiently reduce force production; prefer dynamic warm-ups before training
- Target areas of restriction that limit exercise form (hip flexors, ankles, thoracic spine are common)

### Foam Rolling / Self-Myofascial Release
- Duration: 1-2 minutes per muscle group
- Pressure: moderate; discomfort is fine, sharp pain is not
- Timing: pre-workout (reduces perceived stiffness, does not impair performance), post-workout (may reduce DOMS perception), or standalone
- Mechanism is primarily neurological (pain tolerance, parasympathetic shift), not mechanical tissue change
- Effective areas: quads, IT band/lateral thigh, glutes, thoracic spine, calves, lats

### Mobility Routine Guidelines
- Frequency: daily is ideal; minimum 3x/week for meaningful change
- Duration: 10-15 minutes is sufficient for a general routine
- Focus on joints used in training: ankles, hips, thoracic spine, shoulders
- Mobility gains are transient without reinforcement; use the new range of motion under load (e.g., squat deeper after hip mobility work)
- If a joint restriction persists despite consistent mobility work for 4+ weeks, consider professional assessment (physical therapist)
