# Workout Programming Reference

## Progressive Overload

### Core Principle
Progressive overload is the gradual increase of stress placed on the body during training. Without it, adaptation stalls. Overload can be applied through multiple variables.

### Overload Variables (in priority order)
1. **Volume**: total sets per muscle group per week (most reliable driver of hypertrophy)
2. **Intensity (load)**: weight on the bar; increase 2.5-5% when rep targets are met
3. **Frequency**: training a muscle group more often (2-4x/week generally superior to 1x)
4. **Density**: same work in less time (shorter rest periods)
5. **Range of motion**: increasing ROM where safe (e.g., deficit deadlifts, deep squats)

### Progression Models
- **Linear progression** (beginners): add 2.5-5 lbs every session; works for 3-9 months
- **Weekly progression** (intermediate): add weight or reps week-over-week within a mesocycle
- **Double progression**: hit top of rep range across all sets, then increase weight and reset to bottom of range (e.g., 3x8 at 100 lbs -> 3x10 -> increase to 105 lbs at 3x8)
- **Periodized**: alternate intensity/volume blocks (accumulation -> intensification -> deload)

## Volume Landmarks

### Definitions
- **MV (Maintenance Volume)**: minimum sets/week to maintain current muscle size (~4-6 sets/muscle/week)
- **MEV (Minimum Effective Volume)**: minimum sets/week to produce measurable growth (~6-8 sets)
- **MAV (Maximum Adaptive Volume)**: volume range producing best gains (~10-20 sets, highly individual)
- **MRV (Maximum Recoverable Volume)**: ceiling beyond which recovery fails (~20-25+ sets)

### Per Muscle Group Weekly Set Ranges (intermediate lifters)
| Muscle Group | MV | MEV | MAV | MRV |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chest | 4 | 8 | 12-18 | 22 |
| Back (width) | 4 | 8 | 14-20 | 25 |
| Quads | 4 | 6 | 12-18 | 20 |
| Hamstrings | 3 | 6 | 10-16 | 18 |
| Shoulders (side/rear) | 4 | 8 | 16-22 | 26 |
| Biceps | 3 | 6 | 10-16 | 20 |
| Triceps | 3 | 4 | 8-14 | 18 |
| Calves | 4 | 6 | 10-16 | 20 |

Note: these are general guidelines. Individual MRV varies with training age, sleep, nutrition, stress, and genetics. Start at MEV and titrate up.

## Exercise Categories

### Movement Patterns
- **Horizontal push**: bench press, push-ups, dumbbell press
- **Horizontal pull**: barbell row, cable row, dumbbell row
- **Vertical push**: overhead press, landmine press, pike push-ups
- **Vertical pull**: pull-ups, lat pulldown, chin-ups
- **Hip hinge**: deadlift, Romanian deadlift, hip thrust, good morning
- **Squat/knee dominant**: back squat, front squat, leg press, lunges
- **Carry/core**: farmer walks, planks, pallof press, ab rollouts

### Compound vs Isolation
- **Compound movements**: multi-joint, higher systemic fatigue, greater loading potential, more time-efficient. Should form the backbone of any program (60-70% of total volume).
- **Isolation movements**: single-joint, lower fatigue, target specific muscles, useful for addressing weak points. Use to supplement compounds (30-40% of volume).

### Exercise Selection Principles
- Choose exercises that train the muscle through a full stretch (lengthened partials show strong hypertrophy stimulus)
- Prioritize movements where you feel the target muscle working
- Rotate exercises every 4-8 weeks to manage joint stress and staleness
- Free weights for strength; machines and cables are equally effective for hypertrophy

## Rep Ranges by Goal

### Strength (Neural Adaptations)
- Rep range: 1-5 reps
- Sets: 3-6 per exercise
- Rest: 3-5 minutes
- RPE/RIR: RPE 8-10 / 0-2 RIR
- Primarily compound lifts

### Hypertrophy (Muscle Growth)
- Rep range: 6-12 reps (primary), 12-20 (supplemental)
- Sets: 3-5 per exercise
- Rest: 1.5-3 minutes (compounds), 1-2 minutes (isolation)
- RPE/RIR: RPE 7-9 / 1-3 RIR (most sets should not be to failure)
- Full range of motion; controlled eccentric (2-3 sec)

### Muscular Endurance
- Rep range: 15-30+ reps
- Sets: 2-4 per exercise
- Rest: 30-90 seconds
- Lower load; focus on time under tension and metabolic stress

### Key Insight
Hypertrophy occurs across all rep ranges when sets are taken close to failure. The 6-12 range is practical (balances load and volume), not physiologically exclusive.

## Cardio Guidelines

### Zone 2 (Aerobic Base)
- Heart rate: 60-70% of max HR (roughly "can hold a conversation" intensity)
- Duration: 30-60 minutes per session
- Frequency: 2-4 sessions/week
- Benefits: mitochondrial density, fat oxidation, cardiovascular health, recovery enhancement
- This is the single highest-ROI cardio investment for most people

### HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training)
- Heart rate: 80-95% max HR during work intervals
- Protocol example: 30 sec work / 60-90 sec rest, 6-10 rounds
- Frequency: 1-2 sessions/week (high systemic fatigue; more is not better)
- Benefits: VO2max improvement, time efficiency, EPOC (excess post-exercise oxygen consumption)
- Schedule away from heavy leg sessions (48 hr minimum separation)

### Steady State Moderate
- Heart rate: 70-80% max HR
- Duration: 20-40 minutes
- Occupies a "gray zone" -- less efficient than zone 2 for base building, less effective than HIIT for VO2max. Use sparingly.

### Cardio and Hypertrophy Interference
- Concurrent training interference is real but manageable
- Separate cardio and lifting by 6+ hours when possible
- Cycling has less interference than running (less eccentric muscle damage)
- Limit total cardio to 3-4 sessions/week when hypertrophy is primary goal

## Deload Protocols

### When to Deload
- Every 4-6 weeks of hard training (proactive deload)
- When performance declines for 2+ consecutive sessions (reactive deload)
- When motivation, sleep quality, or joint health deteriorates
- After a peaking/testing phase

### How to Deload
- **Volume deload (preferred)**: reduce sets by 40-50%, maintain intensity (weight on bar)
- **Intensity deload**: reduce weight by 40-50%, maintain or slightly reduce volume
- **Frequency deload**: drop from e.g. 5 sessions to 3, maintain intensity
- Duration: 1 week (sometimes 5 days is sufficient)
- Do NOT skip deloads. Fatigue is cumulative and masked until it is too late.

## Sample Training Splits

### Push/Pull/Legs (6 days/week)
- Day 1: Push (chest, shoulders, triceps)
- Day 2: Pull (back, biceps, rear delts)
- Day 3: Legs (quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves)
- Day 4: Push
- Day 5: Pull
- Day 6: Legs
- Day 7: Rest
- Best for: intermediate to advanced lifters; high frequency per muscle group (2x/week)

### Upper/Lower (4 days/week)
- Day 1: Upper (horizontal push/pull focus)
- Day 2: Lower (squat/quad focus)
- Day 3: Rest
- Day 4: Upper (vertical push/pull focus)
- Day 5: Lower (hinge/hamstring focus)
- Days 6-7: Rest
- Best for: intermediates; good balance of frequency and recovery

### Full Body (3 days/week)
- Day 1: Squat pattern + horizontal push + vertical pull + accessories
- Day 2: Rest
- Day 3: Hinge pattern + vertical push + horizontal pull + accessories
- Day 4: Rest
- Day 5: Squat or hinge variation + push + pull + accessories
- Days 6-7: Rest
- Best for: beginners, busy schedules, older trainees, those prioritizing recovery

### Selecting a Split
- Training age <1 year: full body 3x/week
- Training age 1-3 years: upper/lower 4x or full body 4x
- Training age 3+ years: PPL 6x, upper/lower 4x, or hybrid
- More important than the split: consistency, progressive overload, adequate volume, and recovery
