# Macro Guidelines

## Protein Targets

### General Recommendations
- **Sedentary**: 0.8g per kg body weight
- **Active**: 1.2-1.6g per kg body weight
- **Very active/athlete**: 1.6-2.2g per kg body weight

### Personal Targets (update with your weight in kg)
- **Maintenance**: ~75g protein daily
- **Active lifestyle**: ~110-150g protein daily
- **High intensity**: ~150-200g protein daily

### Good Protein Sources
- Chicken breast (31g per 100g)
- Salmon (20g per 100g)
- Greek yogurt (17g per cup)
- Eggs (6g each)
- Lean beef (25g per 100g)

## Carbohydrate Targets

### General Recommendations
- **Sedentary**: 130-150g daily
- **Moderately active**: 150-200g daily
- **Active/athlete**: 200-300g daily

### Carb Quality
- **Complex carbs preferred**: Whole grains, vegetables, fruits
- **Limit simple sugars**: Soda, candy, processed foods
- **Timing matters**: More carbs around workouts

### Personal Targets
- **Target**: 200-250g daily (moderately active)
- **Focus on**: Whole grains, vegetables, fruits

## Fat Targets

### General Recommendations
- **Minimum**: 0.8g per kg body weight
- **Moderate**: 1.0g per kg body weight
- **Maximum**: 1.2g per kg body weight

### Fat Quality
- **Healthy fats**: Avocados, nuts, olive oil, fatty fish
- **Limit saturated fats**: Fried foods, processed meats
- **Avoid trans fats**: Many processed foods

### Personal Targets
- **Target**: 70-100g daily
- **Focus on**: Olive oil, nuts, fish

## Sodium Targets

### Recommendations
- **Maximum**: 2,300mg daily
- **Optimal**: 1,500mg daily
- **High sodium warning**: >2,300mg

### Sodium Concerns
- Fast food typically high in sodium
- Processed foods, canned foods often high
- Restaurant meals can exceed daily limit

## Calorie Targets

### Calculating Needs
**Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Formula (Mifflin-St Jeor):**
- Men: (10 × weight kg) + (6.25 × height cm) - (5 × age) + 5
- Multiply by activity factor:
  - Sedentary: 1.2
  - Lightly active: 1.375
  - Moderately active: 1.55
  - Very active: 1.725
  - Extra active: 1.9

### Personal Estimate
Assuming moderately active (update with your stats):
- **Maintenance**: ~2,500-2,800 calories daily
- **Weight loss**: ~2,000-2,300 calories daily
- **Muscle gain**: ~2,800-3,100 calories daily

### Calorie Balance
- **Deficit for weight loss**: -500 calories/day = ~1 lb/week loss
- **Surplus for muscle gain**: +300-500 calories/day
- **Maintenance**: Calorie intake ≈ calories burned

## Fiber Targets

### Recommendations
- **Women**: 25g daily
- **Men**: 38g daily

### Good Fiber Sources
- Vegetables: Broccoli, peas, spinach
- Fruits: Berries, apples, pears
- Whole grains: Brown rice, whole wheat bread
- Legumes: Beans, lentils
- Nuts: Almonds, pistachios

## Daily Tracking Guidelines

### Minimum Logging
- What you ate (food items)
- Meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack)
- Rough quantities

### Ideal Logging
- Specific foods with quantities
- Meal times
- Preparation methods

### Analysis Points
- Protein: Are you hitting daily target?
- Carbs: Complex vs simple ratio
- Fat: Healthy vs unhealthy sources
- Sodium: Watch for high-sodium meals
- Fiber: Getting enough vegetables/fruits
